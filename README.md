# Implementation-of-Image-Enhancement-on-OCT-images-using-FPGA
In this project, we enhanced OCT images using FPGA. Verilog modules were developed for negative transformation, brightness control, and thresholding. MATLAB modules were also created for simulation. We compared the processing time of each operation in Verilog and MATLAB to assess performance improvement.
